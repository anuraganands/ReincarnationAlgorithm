Reincarnation Algorithm (RA)

Copyright (c) 2010, Anuraganand Sharma - All rights reserved.

This Matlab code is the implementation of Reincarnation Algorithm (RA) proposed by Anuraganand Sharma in the paper:
A. Sharma, “A new optimizing algorithm using reincarnation concept,” in 11th IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI), 2010, pp. 281–288.

How to run:
1 - The main program is written in reincarnation.m. Run this program.
2 - It asks for run number. You may enter 1,2,3...
3 - Once the execution is completed, it shows a graph for (-)fitness vs iteration.
4 - This code is only in the draft form as I couldn't find time to improve it further.
